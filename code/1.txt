name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

# 2. Write a program that finds the sum of two integers as inputted by the user and prints a string in the form:
# __ + __ = __

num1 = int(input("Input first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Input second number: "))
sum = num1 + num2
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {sum}")
